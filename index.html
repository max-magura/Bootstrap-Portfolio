                                Hello, my name is Max Magura and I am currently enrolled in the Vanderbilt University Coding Boot Camp. I currenly work as a marketing manager for a national entertainment company, based in Nashville, TN.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>
                                I graduated with honors from Belmont University in 2013 with a degree in Entrepreneurship. After graduation, I worked in the music and event industry before moving to marketing. I have been in marketing for 4 years and in my current position for 2 years.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>
                                In any work environment, I succeed through being analytical, logical, and adaptive. Over the years, I have learned to increase my work pace while maintaining a eye on detail. Through these efforts, I have become more flexible in projects and in decision making in order to choose the best path available with the resources allotted at the time with the understanding that this could change at any moment.
            
                            <p>
                                When I am not working or studying, I enjoy going to concerts, watching movies, taking small hikes here in Nashville, playing disc golf, and spending time with my friends. Through all of this I am joined by my amazing and supportive fianc√©, Andi. We are both from Cookeville, TN and enjoy living close enough to home to see our family. We also have a Great Dane named Margot who is our 3rd partner in crime.
                            </p>
